Summary: The focus of this release was on UI, aesthetics, and more smart features. The UI has been overhauled throughout and Mindscribe branding has been added. Security has also been implemented so journals and notes are only rendered for the user that creates them. We also added a color select to Journals for further customization. A new smart feature was added to Notes, summarize button that automatically summarizes the content of a note for easier reading. Also, automatic mood tracking has been added to notes that are added to a journal that has mood tracking enabled. The notes will appear in All Notes with a mood icon based on the mood of the writing.

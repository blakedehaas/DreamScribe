This meeting occurred directly after our recitation section and we met for one hour.
This week our group discussion revolved around our plan of getting the basic outline of the
project done first.
We discussed our basic outline goals and allocated work for each member.
We decided that Blake would get the Login and Registration page working.
We decided that Ella and Ryan could implement the database.
We decided that Jared would implement the nav bar and connect the pages.
We decided that since John would be out of town, he should hold off and implement the delete
and edit functionality of the notes at a later point in time.
